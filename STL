## 1. Introduction to STL
**What is STL?**  
- Standard Template Library (STL) provides generic, reusable components.

**Components:**
- Containers  
- Iterators  
- Algorithms  
- Functors  
- Allocators  

**Benefits:**
- Code reuse  
- Efficiency  
- Generic programming  
- Reduced development time

## 2. Containers
Containers store collections of objects.

### 2.1 Sequence Containers
Store elements in order of insertion.

- **`vector`**
  - Dynamic array, contiguous memory.
  - Key functions: `push_back`, `pop_back`, `size`, `capacity`, `reserve`, `emplace_back`.

- **`deque`**
  - Double-ended queue, fast insertion/removal at both ends.

- **`list`**
  - Doubly-linked list, fast insertion/removal anywhere.

- **`forward_list`** (C++11)  
  - Singly-linked list.

- **`array`** (C++11)  
  - Fixed-size array.

- **`string`**
  - Sequence of characters with STL-like methods.
